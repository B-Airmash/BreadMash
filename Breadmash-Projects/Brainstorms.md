Idea #1 - CTF Mode
-
Need a America vs Rest of the world server. Rest of the world will include European, african, austrailian and asian players. Maybe south american players can be in the US team to balance out the numbers.We group players into teams based on location. Can be a CTF game. Nothing much that sums it up I think. Default flags are added based on location I think. Also players cannot switch teams(we can just ignore the case where people use vpn to simplify). When they join the game they will join the appropriate team I am guessing currently it is based on number of players. If teams are not balanced(number wise) we could just move players to other team(only when they join the game. no switch command allowed here)
